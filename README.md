### Minesweeper

[Minesweeper](src/main/java/minesweeper)

We have a game board divided into squares. Some of them contain "mines", but we don't know how many there are or where they are. Our goal is to reveal all of the unmined squares without getting blown up. The player opens the cells, trying not to open the cell with the mine. Having opened a cell with a mine, he loses.

Added:
- The first move will never hit a mine
- Even if the flags are over, added the ability to remove any flag for its further use.


### Snake

[Snake](src/main/java/snake)

The player controls a long, thin creature resembling a snake, which crawls along a plane bounded by walls, collecting apples, avoiding collisions with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. Each time the snake eats an apple, it gets longer and move faster, which gradually complicates the game. The player controls the direction of movement of the snake's head (4 directions: up, down, left, right), and the snake's tail follows. The player cannot stop the movement of the snake.
